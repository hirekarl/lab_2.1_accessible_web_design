## Reflection Questions
1. What accessibility enhancements were the most challenging to implement, and why?

*I didn't really encounter any challenges implementing the accessibility enhancements for this assignment.*

2. How do ARIA attributes improve the experience for users relying on assistive technologies?

*ARIA attributes allow those using assistive technologies to use web apps and consume their content without a decrease in ease-of-use or access compared to the experience of those using web apps without assistive technologies. ARIA implementations include the ability to navigate web apps without the use of a mouse, the ability to hear live updates to certain elements read aloud by a screen reader, and many more.*

3. What tools did you use to check color contrast, and how did they help?

*I used the [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/), which allowed me to try foreground and background colors for textual elements and shoot for a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, conforming to the WCAG AA standard.*
